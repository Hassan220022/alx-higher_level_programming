# Python Exceptions Handling

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. It involves implementing various tasks that demonstrate the handling of exceptions in Python.

## Project Details

- **Project Context**: 0x05. Python - Exceptions
- **Weight**: 1
- **Project Duration**: January 22, 2024 - January 23, 2024
- **Auto Review Deadline**: January 23, 2024, at 6:00 AM

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, students should be able to explain and demonstrate their ability to:

- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Differentiate between errors and exceptions.
- Handle exceptions using `try`, `except`, and `finally` statements.
- Implement proper exception handling across various functions.
- Utilize exception handling to manage flow control and error messaging.
- Raise built-in and custom exceptions.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- **Coding Style**: All Python files must adhere to the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.\*).
- **Scripts**: All Python files must include a shebang `#!/usr/bin/python3` at the top and must end with a new line.

## Project Tasks

### Mandatory

1. **Safe list printing**:

   - Function to print x elements from a list handling exceptions where x can be more than the list length.

2. **Safe printing of integers**:

   - Function to print an integer safely with exception handling for non-integer types.

3. **Print and count integers**:

   - Function that prints only integer elements from a list up to a specified number, using exception handling for non-integer types and index errors.

4. **Integers division with debug**:

   - Function that divides two integers and prints the result with robust exception handling and debugging info.

5. **Divide a list**:

   - Function that divides elements of two lists element by element with comprehensive exception handling including type errors and division by zero.

6. **Raise exception**:

   - Simple function to demonstrate raising a standard TypeError.

7. **Raise a message**:
   - Function to raise a NameError with a custom message.

### Advanced

- Functions that extend the basic exception handling capabilities including custom error messages and safe execution of passed functions.

## How to Use

Each script can be executed by running it with Python3 from the terminal. Ensure that execute permissions are set: `chmod +x <filename>`.
