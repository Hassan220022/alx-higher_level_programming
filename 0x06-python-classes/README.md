# Python - Classes and Objects

This project, part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, introduces the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It emphasizes understanding and implementing the basic concepts of classes and objects.

## Project Information

- **Project Title**: 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
- **Weight**: 1
- **Project Duration**: January 23, 2024 - January 24, 2024
- **Auto QA Review Deadline**: January 24, 2024

## Background Context

Object-Oriented Programming is a crucial concept in software development. This project aims to provide a hands-on approach to learning by requiring students to read, understand, and implement OOP concepts through a series of tasks focusing on Python classes.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, I should be able to explain and demonstrate the following:

- Why Python programming is awesome.
- The basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Differences between a class and an instance.
- How to define and interact with classes and instances.
- Understanding of attributes, methods, and properties in Python classes.
- Implementation of data encapsulation and abstraction.
- The usage and function of special methods like `__init__`.
- Pythonic ways to use properties vs. getters and setters.

## Resources

- Object-Oriented Programming articles and videos.
- Python documentation on classes and objects.

## Requirements

- **Environment**: Scripts must be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **Style**: Code must adhere to pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*).
- **Documentation**: Every module, class, and method must include a docstring.

## Tasks

### Mandatory

1. **My first square**: Define a class `Square` that defines a square (simple version).
2. **Square with size**: Define a class `Square` with a private size attribute.
3. **Size validation**: Add validation to the size attribute of the `Square` class.
4. **Area of a square**: Implement a method to calculate the area of a square.
5. **Access and update private attribute**: Implement getter and setter for the size attribute.
6. **Printing a square**: Implement a method to print the square using the "#" character.
7. **Coordinates of a square**: Enhance the `Square` class to accept position attributes.

### Advanced

8. **Singly linked list**: Implement a singly linked list in Python.
9. **Compare 2 squares**: Enable comparison operations for two Square instances.
10. **ByteCode -> Python #5**: Decode Python Bytecode to a Python script.
