# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Overview

This project, part of the ALX SE Foundations curriculum, focuses on advanced Python programming concepts, particularly Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Students will explore classes, objects, methods, attributes, and various OOP principles in Python.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of Python's OOP, including classes, instances, and attributes.
- Implement and manipulate class and instance attributes, and understand the difference between them.
- Work with special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, and property decorators to manage object state and behavior.
- Explore advanced topics such as class methods, static methods, and class vs instance attributes.

## Requirements

- Python scripts should be written in Python 3.8.5 and conform to PEP 8 style guidelines.
- All files must be executable and include a shebang line at the top.
- Do not import any modules unless specified otherwise.

## Tasks

- Create classes with varying complexity, from simple rectangles to managing rectangle comparisons and evaluating Python string representations (`repr`).
- Develop methods to calculate area and perimeter, and handle attribute validation through getters and setters.

## Testing

- Use Python's built-in `doctest` module to execute and evaluate tests placed within docstrings.

## Captain's Log

- Remember to update your captain's log as part of your project submission process.
