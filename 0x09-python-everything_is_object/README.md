# README for 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Overview

This project delves into Python's nature of treating everything as an object, with a focus on understanding the behavior of different types of objects. The project challenges learners to explore Python's object-oriented programming without directly using Python's interpreter to answer questions, encouraging deeper understanding through documentation, discussion, and manual testing.

## Objectives

- Understand what objects, classes, and instances are in Python.
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable objects.
- Recognize and manipulate object references, assignments, and aliases.
- Learn to identify and handle Python's built-in mutable and immutable types.
- Utilize Python functions for identifying object type and memory address.

## Requirements

- Scripts executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Adherence to pycodestyle (PEP 8) standards.
- Scripts must be executable and all files should end with a newline.

## Tasks

This project comprises several tasks that require answering conceptual questions about Python objects, including the effects of modifications on variables, aliasing, object identity, and mutability. Tasks involve exploring scenarios using basic Python types like integers, strings, lists, and tuples to understand how Python manages object creation and memory allocation.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, participants should be able to explain, without external resources:

- The nature of objects in Python and their attributes.
- How Python handles variable assignment and memory allocation.
- The behavior of mutable versus immutable objects in function calls and operations.
