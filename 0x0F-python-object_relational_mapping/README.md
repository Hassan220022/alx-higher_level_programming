# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

## Overview

This project aims to link the powerful worlds of databases and Python programming. It involves using the MySQLdb module to interact with MySQL databases and SQLAlchemy as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to abstract database manipulation through Python classes.

## Technologies

- Python Scripts are written with Python 3.8.5
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- MySQLdb version 2.0.x
- SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x

## Learning Objectives

- Connect to a MySQL database from Python.
- Perform CRUD operations.
- Understand and implement ORM.
- Map Python Classes to MySQL tables.

## Requirements

- All scripts must end with a new line.
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.8.\*).
- All files must be executable.
- The code should not be executed when imported.

## Setup

To run the scripts, you'll need a MySQL server and the necessary Python packages. Install them using:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-dev libmysqlclient-dev zlib1g-dev
python3 -m pip install mysqlclient SQLAlchemy
```

## Usage

Each script is executable. For example:

```bash
./0-select_states.py root root hbtn_0e_0_usa
```
