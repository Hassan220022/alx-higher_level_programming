# README for 0x10. Python - Network #0

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Foundations curriculum, focusing on networking concepts with practical exercises involving Bash scripting and Python programming. Students will delve into HTTP protocols, URL components, HTTP methods, and using cURL for network requests.

## Objectives

- Understanding and interpreting URLs, HTTP requests and responses.
- Familiarization with HTTP methods, status codes, and headers.
- Proficiency in making network requests using cURL and handling cookies.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, students should be able to:

- Describe the structure and components of a URL and HTTP protocol.
- Identify and use different HTTP methods and understand the status codes.
- Handle cookies and craft network requests with cURL.
- Analyze network traffic to determine server behaviors and responses.

## Project Tasks

1. **cURL body size:** Write a script that captures the size of an HTTP response.
2. **cURL to the end:** Fetch and display the body of an HTTP response.
3. **cURL Method:** Send a DELETE request and handle the response.
4. **cURL only methods:** Determine the HTTP methods supported by a server.
5. **cURL headers:** Send a custom header with a GET request.
6. **cURL POST parameters:** Make a POST request with specific parameters.
7. **Find a peak:** Implement an algorithm to find a peak in a list of integers.
8. **Advanced tasks:** Include handling JSON data, managing HTTP status codes, and interactive server scripts.

## Requirements

- Scripts must run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Bash scripts are limited to 3 lines.
- All files must end with a newline, be executable, and adhere to pycodestyle standards.
