# 0x11. Python - Network #1

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. It focuses on network programming with Python, covering the usage of the `urllib` and `requests` packages to fetch internet resources.

## Learning Objectives

- How to fetch internet resources with Python's `urllib` and `requests` packages.
- Understanding and decoding responses from HTTP requests.
- Making various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
- Handling JSON data fetched from the internet.
- Manipulating data from external services.

## Requirements

- Scripts must be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All Python files should be executable and follow Pycodestyle (PEP 8) guidelines.

## Tasks

### Mandatory

0. **What's my status? #0**: Script that fetches a URL using `urllib`.
1. **Response header value #0**: Fetches and displays the value of the `X-Request-Id` variable found in the header.
2. **POST an email #0**: Sends a POST request with an email parameter.
3. **Error code #0**: Manages HTTPError exceptions and prints the HTTP status code.
4. **What's my status? #1**: Similar to task 0 but uses `requests` package.
   ... (additional tasks descriptions)

### Advanced

10. **Time for an interview!**: Lists 10 commits of a repository using the GitHub API.

## Setup

To run scripts locally:

```bash
chmod +x <script_name>.py
./

py <script_name>.py
```

Ensure you replace `<script_name>` with the actual name of the Python script.

## Documentation

All modules, classes, and functions should have detailed documentation strings explaining their purpose and usage.

## Testing

To check the code style compliance, you can use:

```bash
pycodestyle <script_name>.py
```
